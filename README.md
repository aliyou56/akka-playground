### Goal

- Asynchronous
- Backpressured
- Incremental
- Potentially infinite data processing systems

Reactive Streams
  - Specification of async, backpressured Streams
  - concepts
    - [Source] publisher: emits elements (asynchronously)
    - [Sink]   subscriber: receives elements
    - [Flow]   processor: transforms elements along the way
    - (async) publisher ~> processor ~> subscriber
    - backpressure
